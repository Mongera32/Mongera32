I develop cloud applications and data pipelines for businesses. My current job consists of the construction of a pipeline that feeds an industrial process simulator.

I have a Masterâ€™s degree in Chemical Engineering, and my fascination for science and technology led me to seek a data science career. I have a knack for improving processes, always seeking the best tools and techniques in a profession that evolves rapidly and constantly.

My research during my graduate couse was on mathematical models, and this experience served as a solid foundation on which I built my knowledge on data pipelines, data analysis and machine learning.
